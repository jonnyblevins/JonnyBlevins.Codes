Personal website with intended domain extension. Includes links to resume and LinkTree sites.

You shouldn't have to download any programs to get this website to run; it is powered by the tinest bit of Javascript, a hefty chunk of CSS, and the rest is good old HTML.

Thanks for taking the time to read:

So, this website is my digital space where I showcase who I am and what I do. The main header introduces me, Jonny Blevins, in a bold, eye-catching way. I don't love the font, but I'm hoping for a professional yet pixelated kind of introduction that illustrates a little of my essence. Right below that, there's an intro section with on of those fun AI-generated personal portraits and a brief, but solid rundown of my background. You get to know I'm a West Virginia native with a passion for project management, teaching, and getting people to visualize data.

The Noteworthy Experience section takes you through my professional journey—each job has a neat little card with the company logo, my title, and the years I worked there. You’ll find links to companies like GE Aerospace, Shepherd Security & Comm., and Northern Clearing, giving you direct access to their websites to learn more about them.

Next up is Writing Samples—this section highlights a few articles I’ve written, including one about my experience with Aikido classes and another about a personal creative piece. This is provided for the "cutlural fit" for whatever place I'm working for or for whoever wants to hire me freelance. I like a human element, so I provide it for others. Oh, and there's a link to my blog "Alligator Smile" where I talk very informally about anything from coding to art.

In the Certifications section, you’ll find a showcase of my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner badge with a link to verify the certification. The Education section is where I list all the schools I've attended, including CanCode Communities and Chatham University, with logos and links to their respective sites.

Then, there's a Projects section, where I’ve linked to some of my favorite work, like "Breaking Plaid," a GitHub group project, and "Pixel Promoters," my SQL/ETL project. I doubt anyone is exploring my Github, but if they did, they'd be able to explore these in detail by checking out the links to the corresponding GitHub repositories.

Lastly, there’s a Links section with my Linktree (for all my other online profiles) and my resume. Each of these has a clickable icon for quick access.

The overall look of the site is dark and minimalist, with a sleek, high-contrast color scheme for readability. The playful 'Handjet' font keeps things fun and approachable (or at least I hope it does). Images are clean, with circular logos for jobs, schools, and projects, giving it a neat, modern touch. Everything’s responsive too, so the site works well on the devices I've tested them on.

As you scroll, elements gradually fade in with smooth transitions, making the site feel dynamic and engaging. Plus, hover effects on the icons and links make everything interactive. The whole experience is designed to flow seamlessly, guiding you through my work and background, making sure it’s an enjoyable and easy journey.
